used to communicate with visitors and obtain information that visitors may want
to share on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>To illustrate the usage of web forms, this section contains two web forms:</p>

<ul>
	<li><i>Visitor Information</i> web form to collect information about
	visitors;
	<li><i>Feedback</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The forms are created in simplified mode without statuses. Templates of each
form is created manually in the visual web form editing mode.</p>

<p>If a web form contains errors, an attempt to send it (save the result) will
cause the error message to be displayed. If a web form is filled and send with
no errors, a positive success message will be displayed. Web forms are published
using the <b>Web Form Filling</b> component.';
