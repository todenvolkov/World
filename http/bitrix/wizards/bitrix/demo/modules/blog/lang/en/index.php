For users without any programming skills, it is more convenient to create pages in the visual HTML editor whose tools are similar to those of Microsoft Word. Besides that, the HTML editor shows the page just as it will look in the public section.

While editing a page in the HTML editor, you can also add a link to it to the menu of the section in which a page is created. To do so, open the Menu tab, specify the item name and select the type of the menu where this item is to be added.
