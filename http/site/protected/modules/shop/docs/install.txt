Thank you for trying the Yii Webshop module!

To install this module, follow these steps:

1.) extract the file under the modules/ directory of your Web Application. If the directory does not exist, create it.

2.) set up the Module in your protected/config/main.php:

return array(
 [...]
 'modules' => array('shop' => array( 'debug' => 'true')),
 [...]

3.) run <webapp_url>/shop/install in your Web Browser

4.) follow the on-screen installation instructions (in most cases simply click
the install button)

5.) Create an empty directory containing your product Images. By Default, this
is approot/productimages. Make sure it is writable by your Web Server Process.

6.) After Installation, make sure to remove the 'debug' => 'true' in
your Configuration.

7.) Set the option 'notifyAdminEmail' to a valid email address to receive
an email every time a consumer orders a product

8.) Read docs/config.txt for other Configuration Options
